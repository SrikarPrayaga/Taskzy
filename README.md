# The plan ahead

I plan to add reminders for stuff like drink water, alarm, meetings etc. 

Some minor changes which the users have requested on the playstore are:

1. Sort the apps in alphabetical order.

2. Edit/Delete a task-situation pair.

More details in the issues. I could really use some help there.
